My name is Manar Mohaisen, and I am an Associate Professor of Computer Science at [Nortehastern Illinois University](https://www.neiu.edu). My reseach is in system and internet security and applications of artificial intelligence therein, social network analysis for education and marketing. Preior to joining [NEIU](https://www.neiu.edu), I was an Assistant Professor at [Korea University of Technology and Education](koreatech.ac.kr). 

I obtained my Ph.D. from [Inha University](inha.ac.kr), South Korea, in 2010, and my M.Sc. from [Côte d'Azur University](https://univ-cotedazur.fr/) in 2005.

  <h3>Advancing Computer Science Transfers for Success</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Funding Agency:</strong> National Science Foundation (NSF)</li>
    <li><strong>Grant Number:</strong> #2130406</li>
    <li><strong>Role:</strong> Co-Principal Investigator (Co-PI)</li>
    <li><strong>Award Amount:</strong> $1,500,000</li>
    <li><strong>Duration:</strong> 2023–2026</li>
    <li><strong>Summary:</strong> This NSF-funded project at Northeastern Illinois University supports 45 high-achieving, low-income transfer students in Computer Science through scholarships, mentoring, and an industry-aligned curriculum. Aiming to increase retention and student performance in introductory courses, the project evaluates how curricular enhancements and mentoring improve retention, graduation, and career outcomes, with findings shared across academic and professional platforms to inform broader STEM education efforts.

  <h3> Mobility of higher education students and staff supported by external policy funds</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Funding Agency:</strong> Eurasmus+ </li>
    <li><strong>Role:</strong> NEIU Co-Lead</li>
    <li><strong>Award Amount:</strong> 58,280 Euros</li>
    <li><strong>Duration:</strong> 2022–2025</li>
    <li><strong>Extended Duration:</strong> 2026-2028</li>
    <li><strong>Summary:</strong> The goal of this project is to enhance international academic cooperation between Northeastern Illinois University (NEIU) and Karlsruhe University of Education (KUE) through a blended mobility program focused on computer science and digital education. It aims to provide students—especially those with limited opportunities—with accessible international experiences that combine virtual learning and short-term physical exchange. The project is designed to foster intercultural competence, improve digital education skills, and strengthen academic collaboration between faculty members from the partner institutions through joint teaching, training, and research. It also supports institutional goals of internationalization, equity, and innovation in pedagogy.
