My name is Manar Mohaisen, and I am an Associate Professor of Computer Science at [Nortehastern Illinois University](https://www.neiu.edu). My reseach is in system and internet security and applications of artificial intelligence therein, social network analysis for education and marketing. Preior to joining [NEIU](https://www.neiu.edu), I was an Assistant Professor at [Korea University of Technology and Education](koreatech.ac.kr). 

I obtained my Ph.D. from [Inha University](inha.ac.kr), South Korea, in 2010, and my M.Sc. from [Côte d'Azur University](https://univ-cotedazur.fr/) in 2005.
