My name is Manar Mohaisen, and I am an Associate Professor of Computer Science at [Nortehastern Illinois University](https://www.neiu.edu). My reseach is in system and internet security and applications of artificial intelligence therein, social network analysis for education and marketing. Preior to joining [NEIU](https://www.neiu.edu), I was an Assistant Professor at [Korea University of Technology and Education](koreatech.ac.kr). 

I obtained my Ph.D. from [Inha University](inha.ac.kr), South Korea, in 2010, and my M.Sc. from [Côte d'Azur University](https://univ-cotedazur.fr/) in 2005.

  <h2>Advancing Computer Science Transfers for Success</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Funding Agency:</strong> National Science Foundation (NSF)</li>
    <li><strong>Grant Number:</strong> #2130406</li>
    <li><strong>Role:</strong> Co-Principal Investigator (Co-PI)</li>
    <li><strong>Award Amount:</strong> $1,500,000</li>
    <li><strong>Duration:</strong> 2023–2026</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Project Summary</h3>
  <p>
    This NSF-funded project at <strong>Northeastern Illinois University (NEIU)</strong>, a Hispanic Serving Institution, supports
    <strong>45 high-achieving, low-income transfer students</strong> pursuing Computer Science degrees. Over six years,
    students from partner community colleges will receive:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Two-year scholarships</li>
    <li>Mentorship from faculty, alumni, and industry professionals</li>
    <li>An enhanced curriculum featuring industry-standard tools and methodologies</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Goals and Impact</h3>
  <p>
    The project targets high attrition in introductory CS courses by evaluating the effectiveness of:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Curricular improvements</li>
    <li>Active mentoring</li>
    <li>Non-curricular student support activities</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The ultimate goal is to increase STEM degree completion, retention, and career readiness. Evaluation methods include surveys, interviews, and academic performance data.
    Findings will be disseminated through:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Conferences</li>
    <li>Academic journals</li>
    <li>Professional networks such as the Computing Alliance of Hispanic Serving Institutions (CAHSI)</li>
  </ul>

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "Use this template" button in the top right. 


Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one Markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a Markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each Markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).
