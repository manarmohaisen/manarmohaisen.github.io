My name is Manar Mohaisen, and I am an Associate Professor of Computer Science at [Nortehastern Illinois University](https://www.neiu.edu). My reseach is in system and internet security and applications of artificial intelligence therein, social network analysis for education and marketing. Preior to joining [NEIU](https://www.neiu.edu), I was an Assistant Professor at [Korea University of Technology and Education](koreatech.ac.kr). 

I obtained my Ph.D. from [Inha University](inha.ac.kr), South Korea, in 2010, and my M.Sc. from [Côte d'Azur University](https://univ-cotedazur.fr/) in 2005.

  <h3>Advancing Computer Science Transfers for Success</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Funding Agency:</strong> National Science Foundation (NSF)</li>
    <li><strong>Grant Number:</strong> #2130406</li>
    <li><strong>Role:</strong> Co-Principal Investigator (Co-PI)</li>
    <li><strong>Award Amount:</strong> $1,500,000</li>
    <li><strong>Duration:</strong> 2023–2026</li>
    <li><strong>Summary:</strong> This NSF-funded project at Northeastern Illinois University supports 45 high-achieving, low-income transfer students in Computer Science through scholarships, mentoring, and an industry-aligned curriculum. Aiming to reduce attrition in introductory courses, the project evaluates how curricular enhancements and mentoring improve retention, graduation, and career outcomes, with findings shared across academic and professional platforms to inform broader STEM education efforts.

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "Use this template" button in the top right. 


Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one Markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a Markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each Markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).
