This course covers various advanced security concepts, tools, and models. Topics covered include computer networks design elements, web security and client- and server-side attacks, email security, application security with emphasis on email security and database authentication and authorization, network security, network perimter security, cryptography, system security, and Internet security. Building upon the introduced security fundamentals, advanced enterprise security topics, including static and dynamic malware analysis, and cybersecurity defense and threat intelligence frameworks will be introduced. Hands-on experience will be provided through several laboratory sessions and a final module on penetration testing.
