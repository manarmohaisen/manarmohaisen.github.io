excerpt: 'This paper presents Zad, a system that enhances the brief and often outdated descriptions in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) by leveraging external sources. Zad uses a dual-pipeline approach—data collection and model fine-tuning—to generate richer, more informative vulnerability summaries, and shows strong performance based on both automated metrics and human evaluations.'
